						<p>In Seeds, toddlers and nursery age children are taught the Bible in a fun and interactive way. The children jump and sing along to age appropriate worship, engage in role play and puppet shows, and have loads of toys to keep their little bodies and minds busy. We aim to create a fun, safe and loving environment.</p>
